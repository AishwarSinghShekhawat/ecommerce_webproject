Before you execute this project make sure you insert values in the database.
to insert values in the database just type this command.

```sql
INSERT INTO Producttb (product_name, product_price, product_image)
        VALUES ('ALPHA TENT',499,'./upload/practice1.jpg'),
                        ('BETA TENT',147,'./upload/practice2.jpg'),
                        ('GAMMA',459,'./upload/practice3.jpg'),
                        ('INFRA',278,'./upload/practice4.jpg')
